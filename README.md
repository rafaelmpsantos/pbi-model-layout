# pbi-model-layout

Automatically arranges Power BI model diagram views into clean, relationship-aware layouts. Detects fact and dimension tables by prefix, reads real node sizes from the `.pbix`, and writes positions back - no manual dragging required.

Available as both a **command-line tool** and a **graphical interface**.
Now also includes a **web application** ready for Azure Web App deployment.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- No external packages (stdlib only)

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Graphical Interface (Recommended)

```bash
python pbi_layout_gui.py
```

### Option 2: Command Line

```bash
# 1. Extract relationships from your model
python pbix_layout_tool.py --extract-relations your_model.pbit

# 2. Apply the layout
python pbix_layout_tool.py your_model.pbix --relations relations.json
```

Open the generated `your_model_arranged.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.

### Option 3: Web App (Upload `.pbit` and return relations)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python web_app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`, upload your `.pbit`, and the UI will return extracted model insights.
The result screen also renders a relationship diagram (SVG) inspired by the GUI layout logic.

API endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/extract-relations \
  -F "file=@demo_model.pbit"
```

## GUI Preview (v1.2)

The preview canvas renders a live Power BI style model view directly in the tool - color-coded table containers, relationship fields, L-shaped connector lines with cardinality symbols and interactive highlights.

![Layout Preview](layout_preview.png)

The preview above shows a multi-fact model (3 facts, 10 dims, 1 snowflake) rendered with the **auto** layout at 51% zoom. Facts stack on the left; dimension tables line up in a single row below with their fields visible inside each container. L-shaped lines connect fact field rows to the top edges of their dimension tables. Clicking any table highlights it and all directly related tables with a blue border.

---

## GUI Features (v1.2)

### Power BI–Style Preview Canvas

The preview renders your model exactly as it will look in Power BI Desktop's Model View:

- **Color-coded containers** - Blue = Fact, Purple = Dimension, Green = Snowflake, Gray = Other
- **Fields inside containers** - only relationship fields shown (e.g. `dim_customer_id`), sized to fit
- **L-shaped connector lines** - facts exit the right edge, dims are entered from the top, with distributed attachment points so lines never overlap
- **Cardinality symbols** - `*` at the fact side, `1` at the dimension side, drawn on top of containers
- **Legend** - always visible in the top-left corner

### Interactions

- **Zoom** - mouse wheel, 10%–300%, all text and containers scale proportionally
- **Pan** - click and drag the background, smooth pixel-accurate panning
- **Drag tables** - click and drag any table to reposition; positions are cached and used when applying
- **Click a table** - highlights the clicked table (dark blue border) and all directly related tables (light blue border)
- **Click a relationship line** - highlights the line blue and bolds the matching field text in both connected containers
- **Reset Zoom** - returns to the initial zoom-to-fit view

### Layout Modes

Switch between layout strategies using the dropdown in the preview toolbar:

| Mode               | Description                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **auto**           | Smart pick: star for 1 fact, grid for multiple                     |
| **grid**           | Facts stacked left, all dims in a horizontal row below             |
| **horizontal**     | Facts in a row at top, dims in columns below each fact             |
| **star**           | Radial - fact at center, dims in a ring, snowflakes pushed outward |
| **vertical_stack** | Each fact followed immediately by its dims to the right            |

All modes place snowflake tables adjacent to their parent dim (not in a remote row).

### Diagram Tabs

Check **"Create diagram tabs"** in the GUI (or use `--create-tabs` on the CLI) to generate focused views - one tab per fact table:

- **Diagram 0** (master): All tables in chosen layout
- **Diagram 1–N**: One per fact, showing only that fact + connected dims in a star layout

Switch tabs using the diagram selector in Power BI Desktop's Model View (bottom-left corner).

## How to get the `.pbit`

In Power BI Desktop: **File → Save As → Power BI Template (.pbit)**

The `.pbit` is a ZIP containing a human-readable `DataModelSchema` with all relationships. The extractor reads it automatically and writes `relations.json`.

---

## Layout Modes Explained

### Auto Mode

Picks the best layout for your model:

- **Single fact** → Star (fact center, dims in ring)
- **Multiple facts** → Grid (facts left column, dims below)

### Grid Layout

```
fct_Orders
fct_Inventory     dim_A  dim_B  dim_C  ...  dim_Parent  dim_Child
fct_WebSessions
```

### Horizontal Layout

Facts across the top, each fact's dims stacked in a column below it. Snowflake children placed directly below their parent dim.

### Star Layout

Fact at center, dims radiate outward in a ring. Snowflake children pushed further out along the same angle as their parent dim. For multiple facts, creates a 2-column grid of star clusters.

### Vertical Stack

Each fact followed immediately by its dims in a row to the right. Snowflake children placed inline after their parent dim. Orphan dims collected below.

## Command-Line Options

| Flag                   | Default                 | Description                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `--output FILE`        | `input_arranged.pbix`   | Output path                                  |
| `--relations FILE`     | -                       | Path to `relations.json`                     |
| `--fact-prefixes`      | `fct_,fact_,FCT_,FACT_` | Comma-separated fact table prefixes          |
| `--dim-prefixes`       | `dim_,DIM_,Dim_,d_,D_`  | Comma-separated dim table prefixes           |
| `--radius N`           | `520`                   | Star layout: radius from fact to dim ring    |
| `--create-tabs`        | -                       | Generate focused diagram tabs (one per fact) |
| `--extract-relations`  | -                       | Extract relationships from a `.pbit`         |
| `--generate-relations` | -                       | Print a blank `relations.json` template      |
| `--dry-run`            | -                       | Print layout plan without writing anything   |

## `relations.json` Format

```json
[
  { "from": "fct_Orders", "to": "dim_Customer" },
  { "from": "fct_Orders", "to": "dim_Product" },
  { "from": "dim_Product", "to": "dim_Category" }
]
```

`"from"` is the many-side (fact or parent dim), `"to"` is the one-side (dim or child dim). Direction is for readability only - the tool infers roles from prefixes.

---

## Workflow

1. **Extract relationships**
   - Open the GUI and use Step 1 or run `--extract-relations` on your `.pbit`
   - Generates `relations.json`

2. **Preview and adjust**
   - Select your `.pbix` and `relations.json` in the GUI
   - Click **Preview Layout**
   - Try different layout modes, zoom in/out, drag tables to fine-tune
   - Click any table to see its relationships highlighted

3. **Apply**
   - Click **Apply This Layout** (from preview) or **Apply Layout** (from main window)
   - Output written to `*_arranged.pbix`
   - Open in Power BI Desktop → Model View
